\subsection{Testing the Added Mutators}
The augmented Pitest is run on 5 real world projects from GitHub and is evaluated for its functionality.
We could see increased mutation coverage and line coverage in Project Summary report available in target/pit-reports directory of the project.
We also analyzed the additional mutations generated by AOD, AOR, and ROR in different java source files and the status of the mutations, that is, Survived, Killed or No Coverage.
The following projects were used for testing the added mutators:
\begin{itemize}
\item

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notable Problems}
\subsubsection{AOD With More Than Two Operands}
In an expression such as \java{a + b + c}, it is possible to apply AOD mutation to retain \java{a + b} and \java{c}; \java{b + c} and \java{a}; and \java{a + c} and \java{b}.
However, the current AOD implementation recursively returns \java{a}, \java{b}, \java{c} operands separately.
Adding handling of consecutive arithmetic operations may be considered for future improvements, but at the moment we do not see the significance of these mutations;
they will add more mutations to evaluate the tests but might not give better evaluation.

\subsubsection{Grouping the Added Mutators}
To register the mutations, we have to add them to \path{Mutator.java}.
This is trivial for AOD and AOR.
However for ROR, we need to test each mutator individually and split the enum of ROR into several parts.
It is possible to group all the enums into one class so we do not have to add many mutations to the \path{pom.xml} files of test projects.

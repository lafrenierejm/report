The augmented Pitest is run on 5 real world projects from GitHub and is evaluated for its functionality.
We could see increased mutation coverage and line coverage in Project Summary report available in target/pit-reports directory of the project.
We also analyzed the additional mutations generated by AOD, AOR, and ROR in different java source files and the status of the mutations, that is, Survived, Killed or No Coverage.

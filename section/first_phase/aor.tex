\subsection{Arithmetic Operator Replacement}
The mutation operator Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR) replaces basic arithmetic operators with other arithmetic operators. Pitest mutation testing tool implements only a subset of AOR, which is available within Math Mutator. The replacements available in Math Mutator are given below.\newline

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline
	Original Operator & Mutated Operator\\
	\hline
    + & -\\
	\hline
    - & +\\
	\hline
    * & /\\
	\hline
    / & *\\
	\hline
    \% & *\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}\\


In Phase One of this project, all missing AOR mutators are implemented. The entire replacements available in augmented PIT are summarized in below table.\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline
	Original Operator & Mutated Operators\\
	\hline
    + & -, *, /, \% \\
	\hline
    - & +, *, /, \%\\
	\hline
    * & +, -, /, \%\\
	\hline
    / & +, -, *, \%\\
	\hline
    \% & +, -, *, /\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}\\

We have implemented integer, double, float and long versions of above arithmetic mutators.
